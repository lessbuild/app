# Signal theme integration progress

## Slice 1 — shared theme and application shell

Status: implemented locally; commit and push pending verification handoff.

The application now includes the actual Signal Starter source from:

```text
/root/Documents/Codex/2026-09-21/plan-can-you-create-a-tailwindcss
```

The vendored snapshot contains Signal's theme tokens, component styles,
generated palettes and theme data under `resources/css/signal/`. BuildPusher
defaults to Signal's `graphite` palette, `subtle` corners, comfortable density,
system appearance and the existing persisted user dark-theme preference when it
is available.

The shared Laravel shell now loads Signal's theme entry points through Vite,
uses the Signal control and surface primitives, and exposes a theme toggle in
the authenticated header. Existing BuildPusher utility names remain supported
through an explicit compatibility bridge so route behavior and page migrations
can proceed incrementally without a second palette.

Preserved contracts:

- Routes, controllers, Livewire components, forms and validation behavior.
- Modal, navigation and scroll-lock JavaScript hooks.
- Existing user `preferences.theme` values (`light` and `dark`).
- Existing non-JavaScript and responsive navigation markup.
- Local-only assets and the current locked dependency set.

Evidence:

- `npm run build` — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.
- `php artisan view:cache` — passed.
- `php artisan test tests/Feature/LocalUiAssetTest.php --do-not-record-test-run-history` — 23 passed, 475 assertions.

Next task: migrate the first representative page family (dashboard and
provider inventory/create-edit dialogs) to Signal's actual application-shell
component vocabulary, then run desktop/mobile browser coverage before pushing
that slice.
